/*:
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image:
 
 ![subhumans-no-grid](subhumans-no-grid.png "Subhumans")
 ![subhumans-with-grid](subhumans-with-grid.png "Subhumans")
 
 By precisely reproducing this image, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
 
 * sequence (order of statements in a program)
 * conditionals (making decisions with ``if`` statements)
 * iteration (use of loops to repeat statements)
 
 You can use the **Digital Color Meter** app (already installed on your Mac) to find specific colours as RGB (red-green-blue) codes.
 
 You [can use this site](http://www.workwithcolor.com/color-converter-01.htm) to convert colours to HSB to use with the Canvas class.
 
 Or, if you wish, you may use the color constants created below.

canvas.drawText(message: "subhumans", size: 24, x: 100, y: 150, kerning: 0)
// HINT: You can use the kerning property to change the distance between letters
//       Try adjusting the value to positive or negative values. What happens?
